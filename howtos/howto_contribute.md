# How to Contribute

This site is hosted in GitHub Pages and redirected from our team 
domain at [http://mrhsrobotics.com](http://mrhsrobotics.com).  The source material for this site is managed in our 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/MRHS-Robotics/mrhs-robotics).   

So how do team members update this site?  

It's actually pretty easy, and doesn't require any previous experience with web development.  It does, however, require 
that you install some tools on your computer, and have a willingness to learn "markdown" which is a kind of shorthand
for text formatting.  If you've ever updated a wiki page, it should look pretty familiar to you.
