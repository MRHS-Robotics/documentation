# How to Contribute

This site is hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://mrhs-robotics.github.io/mrhs-robotics/) and redirected from our team 
domain at [https://mrhsrobotics.com](https://mrhsrobotics.com).  The source material for this site is managed in our 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/MRHS-Robotics/mrhs-robotics).   

So how do team members update this site?  It's actually pretty easy, and doesn't require any previous experience with
web development.  It does require that you install a few things, though, and have a willingness to learn "markdown",
which is a kind of shorthand for text formatting.  If you've ever updated a wiki page, it should look pretty familiar
to you.
