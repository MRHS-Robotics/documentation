# The Butterfly Effect 

## Our Motto

The Butterfly Effect, coined by [Edward Lornez](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Lorenz), is the theory that a single occurence, such as the flap of a butterfly's wing, can change the course of the universe. We believe that our futures, weather they be in enineering or elsewhere, are impacted immensely by what we do today, right down to the smallest choices to be kind to others. That's why we are in this club, because the small impact we make on students we visit and on one another will one day be huge.
