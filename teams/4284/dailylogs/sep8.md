## Intake Design Notes

Kickoff, Ashley, Jess, Ev, and Buck attended a presentation on the glyph intake design of team Black Diamond and a basic coding course. Notes taken during the presentation included:
* Wheel intake systems are quick and efficient
* Expanding the bot can be the result of a different mechanism pushing the expanding piece out
        * Locking mechanism
* goBilda goRail (screw linear slide thingy) is really compact and efficient

## Challenge

During the challenge our team had to come up with a way to alert crew members of heat resistant tiles becoming damaged on a spaceship. Our team came up with creating a system of wires that would run through a tile, and when the tile was attached to the ship it would complete a circuit that, if the tile falls off or is damaged, would break and set off a signal to the crew alerting them of the damage. In retrospect, we did not consider the expenses of wires that can withstand the heat present in the tiles, because logically the tiles are only thick enough to protect the ship underneath, so anything within the tile would not be as fully protected as it would be behind the tile. Therefore the wires would have to be heavily heat resistant themselves to prevent them from melting. We are unsure ourselves if that would be even possible let alone cost effective to implement in every single tile lining the ship. We also offered the idea of using geiger counters to measure the exposure of radiation on the ship under the (incorrect) assumption that the tiles filter out radiation even if it was a small, but detectable, amount. Considering how expensive geiger counters are, this plan would not be feasible.

## Game Reveal

Initial reactions to the game reveal was that it seemed relatively straight forward, so many teams are going to have similar game strategies. Our game strategy is going to focus on Landing during autonomous and Latching in the end game, since they offer the most points. However, since these offer the most points many other teams are also going to prioritize these tactics, so we canâ€™t rely on them to take us through to finals. Sampling we can achieve with minimal hardware, just a color sensor (and possibly a servo to knock the sample off depending on how close together the samples are placed and how wide our robot it, because otherwise we could ram the samples off), so that would be our second priority. Claiming and parking during autonomous seem to be points -- as long as we have capable wheels to overcome the crater walls -- so we will focus on those once we have a good landing/latching mechanism implemented and a reliable sampling program. Collecting gold and silver is going to be the deciding factor between good robots and winning robots, but we want to achieve good before we can get any further, so collection and placement, which may end up being the most difficult aspect, will be our final venture.
