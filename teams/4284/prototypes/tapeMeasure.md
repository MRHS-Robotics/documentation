Tape Measure Bracket Prototype
=====================================

This prototype is the continuation of our efforts to collect the minerals inside the crater. The key aspects of this design in theory are the use of a tape measure to extend and retract the collector, and surgical tubing on an axel to spin and collect the minerals. 
	
	
### **Tape Measure Aspect**

#### Advantages:
* Capable of extending as far as nessicary (40 inches is the ideal extension)
* Compact when in recoiled state
* Lighter than metal alternatives we have explored, such as linear slides
* Quick recoil through use of wheels on either side of tape measure

#### Disadvantages:
* May twist when being recoiled and lose the minerals
* Would require another mechanism to lift the prototype to dispense the minerals

#### Requirements:
* Collection attatchment at the end of the tape measure cant be *too* heavy
* It has to attach securely to the tape measure
* It cannot twist excessively

### **Surgical Tubing Aspect**

#### Advantages:
* Fast collection
* Could push minerals out as well as pull them in
* Requires less driver percision

#### Disadvantages:
* Wouldn't be easy to discriminate between ball and cube minearls
* Axels are heavy and would weigh down the tape measure
* Motors/Servos are heavy ^^^

#### Requirements:
* Axel(s) 
* A motor or servo (not too heavy)
