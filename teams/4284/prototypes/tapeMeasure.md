#Tape Measure Bracket Prototype

		This prototype is the continuation of our efforts to collect the minerals inside the crater. The key aspects of this design in theory are the use of a tape measure to extend and retract the collector, and surgical tubing on an axel to spin and collect the minerals. 
		
### Advantages of Using a Tape Measure
* #### Capable of extending as far as nessicary (40 inches is the ideal extension)
* #### Compact when in recoiled state
* #### Lighter than metal alternatives we have explored, such as linear slides
* #### Easily Manuvered
